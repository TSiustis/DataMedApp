Analysis of clinical trials using natural language processing techniques

This repository contains the code that I wrote for my Bachelor's Thesis Project.

The code is not very well documented.It uses a number of libraries and API's such as Metamap, MySQL, StanfordNLP and more.
I used MySQLWorkbench to build my database.

Some of the libraries are loaded with Maven, the others have to be imported from the lib folder.

To use it you have to download Metamap 2014 server and Java API.
